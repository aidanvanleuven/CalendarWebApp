# CalendarWebApp

Calendar web app the excludes weekends; Built specifically for J&B Drafting.

Intended to be either cast to a 1080p display via Chrome and Chromecast, or displayed on a Raspberry Pi at 1080p.

Ideally viewed and edited in Chrome, using a 1080p display. Anything else is not guaranteed to display or function as intended.

v1.0 release!

More than likely still chock full of bugs and missing functionality ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
